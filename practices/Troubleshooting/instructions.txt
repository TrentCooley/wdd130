
HTML
Select all the code again and copy it. Visit https://validator.w3.org/ and and select the "Validate by Direct Input" tab. Paste your HTML code into the box. Hit "Check"

CSS
Validate your CSS! There is also a CSS standard, so you can validate that as well to check for errors. The process is similar, you just need to go to a different site. The CSS validator can be found at: https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/. Follow the same steps...fix the first error then re-validate until clean.

You should see a list of several errors that are in the HTML of that file. Find and correct all of the errors. Help each other out! Each time you fix errors in your editor you will need to copy the code in the editor and paste them into the box in the validator.


TIPS
Start with the top of the list and work down. Often fixing one issue will resolve multiple errors.

As you fix an error copy/paste the corrected code into the validator and re-check.

Remember that an Element is: an opening tag, closing tag, and everything in between. Look at this example:

<nav>
    <ul>
        <li>Home</li>
        <li>Contact Us</li>
    </ul>
</nav>

The entire block of code is a "nav element" since everything is inside of the opening and closing nav tags. <li>Home</li> is also an element and would be called a "li element".

Elements are often nested (placed inside of each other).

An element inside of another element would be considered a child of the parent element. Referring to our example above, The <li> elements are the children of the <ul> element, and the <ul> element is the child of the <nav> element.

Note that the validator will tell you the line and column where it found the error. Use this as a starting point when searching out the issues.
