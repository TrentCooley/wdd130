        <b>Accomplishments</b> I have a variety of experiences working throughout the field of technology. Some accomplishments that I have made throughout this field are a Bachelor's degree in CIT (Computer Information Technology) and multiple certificates in cybersecurity. Additionally, I have worked on reports in cybersecurity, and have worked on many teams including the cybersecurity club at Brigham Young University-Idaho. In total, I have learned five programming languages which include: Python, C++, Hyper Text Markup Language (HTML), Cascading Style Sheets (CSS), Javascript, and Structured Query Langauge (SQL). 

      </br></br>
        <b>Experience</b>  I have experience working with a variety of computer programs. A few different types of programs that I have worked on are front and back-end development, machine learning, and database development. I have worked with the back end of computers extensively which includes networking and server-side programs. Python and SQL are the two languages I have the most experience with. I have been working with Python for five years and SQL for three years. I have configured my own network through a router that included a firewall. Additionally, I have experience participating in a cybersecurity activity called Capture the Flag. This activity gave me experience with finding vulnerabilities in computer systems.

      </br></br>
        <b>Projects</b> Over the years I have had the opportunity to participate in and lead a variety of technology-based projects. A few projects that I have participated in and completed are text-generation machine learning, roadsign recognition, RSA encryption server, and information databases. The projects that I used the language Python in are the text-generation machine learning, roadsign recognition, and RSA encryption server projects. The projects that I used the language SQL in were a variety of information databases.

      </br></br>
        <b>Characteristics</b> Throughout my experiences and learning I have grown as an individual, a teammate, and a learner. I am hardworking, trustworthy, and reliable. Working in groups has shown me that I can be a reliable teammate. This was shown as I completed my portion of assignments in a timely manner and before the due date. I have also helped my teammates and classmates understand the content of an assignment or lesson when needed. I am also organized and flexible. While working in groups and partnerships I have learned to be open to others ideas and adaptive to the execution of ideas by others. Being flexible has allowed me to have a rapport with my teammates and also be exposed to a variety of ideas and concepts. I had the opportunity to serve a two-year mission on behalf of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. While serving I was able to develop and grow in my communication and social skills. Throughout those two years, I talked to new people every day and taught them new concepts or ideas about my religion. As a result, I can clearly communicate ideas to others, express my opinion, and teach others in a way that they can understand. Overall, these skills that I possess allow me to be an effective employee and coworker.
