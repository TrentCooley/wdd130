        have made several different projects like a texting 
        program to tell me weather or not a product is available 
        and making a Minecraft server on a raspberry pi. currently 
        I am working on a project that would allow me to connect to
        my pc at home from my phone or my laptop anywhere as long 
        as I have internet.
