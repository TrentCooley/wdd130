        <h3>Experience</h3>
        <h4>Techical Experience</h4>
        <p>
            I have experience working with a variety of computer programs. A few different types of
            programs that I have worked on are front and back-end development, machine learning, and database
            development. I have worked with the back end of computers extensively which includes networking and
            server-side programs. Python and SQL are the two languages I have the most experience with. I have been
            working with Python for five years and SQL for three years. I have configured my own network through a
            router that included a firewall. Additionally, I have experience participating in a cybersecurity activity
            called Capture the Flag. This activity gave me experience with finding vulnerabilities in computer systems.
        </p>

        <h4>Accomplishments</h4>
        <p>
            I have a variety of experiences working throughout the field of technology. Some
            accomplishments that I have made throughout this field are a Bachelor's degree in CIT (Computer Information
            Technology) and multiple certificates in cybersecurity. Additionally, I have worked on reports in
            cybersecurity, and have worked on many teams including the cybersecurity club at Brigham Young
            University-Idaho. In total, I have learned five programming languages which include: Python, C++, Hyper Text
            Markup Language (HTML), Cascading Style Sheets (CSS), Javascript, and Structured Query Langauge (SQL).
        </p>

        <h4>Projects</h4>
        <p>
            Over the years I have had the opportunity to participate in and lead a variety of
            technology-based projects. A few projects that I have participated in and completed are text-generation
            machine learning, roadsign recognition, RSA encryption server, and information databases. The projects that
            I used the language Python in are the text-generation machine learning, roadsign recognition, and RSA
            encryption server projects. The projects that I used the language SQL in were a variety of information
            databases.
